# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hello, world" 

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 20

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 20 + 27

# Strings
# puts "hello, world"

# Combine strings together
# puts "tacos" * 3
puts "#{3+2} tacos"

# Variables

quantity = 3 + 3 + 3
food = "tacos"

# Combine strings and variables
puts "#{quantity} #{food}"

# String manipulation
